# Development-and-Analysis-of-Banking-Malware
Objective: 
Create a proof-of-concept (PoC) banking trojan to understand its capabilities and analyze its impact on banking systems.
Scope:

1. Develop a PoC Malware Targeting a Banking Application

Key Capabilities:

    Keylogging: Capture and log keystrokes from the infected machine.
    Screen Capturing: Periodically capture screenshots of the infected machine.
    Data Exfiltration: Send the captured data to a remote server controlled by the attacker.

Development Tools:

    Programming Language: Python or C++ (Python for simplicity, C++ for more advanced capabilities).
    Libraries:
        Keylogging: pynput (Python), Windows API (C++).
        Screen Capturing: PIL/Pillow (Python), GDI+ (C++).
        Data Exfiltration: requests (Python), WinInet API (C++).

        2. Analyze the Malware Using Reverse Engineering Tools

Reverse Engineering Tools:

    IDA Pro: Interactive DisAssembler for binary analysis.
    Ghidra: Open-source reverse engineering tool developed by NSA.

Analysis Steps:

    Static Analysis:
        Load the compiled binary into IDA Pro or Ghidra.
        Identify and analyze key functions, strings, and resources.
        Understand the control flow and data flow of the malware.

    Dynamic Analysis:
        Execute the malware in a controlled environment (sandbox) to observe its behavior.
        Use debuggers (e.g., x64dbg) to step through the code and monitor system calls and API usage.

3. Test the Malware in a Controlled Environment

Controlled Environment Setup:

    Virtual Machines: Use VirtualBox or VMware to create isolated VMs.
    Sandbox: Tools like Cuckoo Sandbox for automated malware analysis.
    Network Simulation: Configure a virtual network to simulate internet connectivity and exfiltration targets.

Testing Steps:

    Deploy the Malware: Install the PoC malware on the virtual machine.
    Monitor Behavior: Use monitoring tools (e.g., Wireshark, Process Monitor) to observe the malware's actions.
    Verify Functionality: Ensure keylogging, screen capturing, and data exfiltration are functioning as intended.

4. Implement and Document Detection Techniques

Detection Techniques:

    Signature-Based Detection: Create signatures based on the malware's binary and behavior patterns.
    Heuristic Analysis: Analyze unusual behavior patterns, such as unexpected network connections or file modifications.
    Behavior Analysis: Use tools like Sysinternals Suite to monitor system behavior (e.g., new processes, registry changes).

Anti-Malware Solutions:

    Static Analysis Tools: Use tools like ClamAV for signature-based detection.
    Dynamic Analysis Tools: Use behavior analysis tools like Process Monitor, Sysmon.

Documentation:

    Provide detailed steps for each detection method.
    Include screenshots and logs from monitoring tools.

5. Provide a Comprehensive Report

Report Structure:

    Introduction: Overview of the project and objectives.
    Development: Detailed steps for developing the PoC malware, including code snippets and explanations.
    Analysis: Static and dynamic analysis using reverse engineering tools, including findings and screenshots.
    Testing: Steps and results from testing the malware in a controlled environment.
    Detection Techniques: Detailed documentation of detection methods, including setup instructions and results.
    Impact and Mitigation: Analysis of the potential impact on banking systems and recommendations for mitigation.

Key Considerations

    Ethical Boundaries:
        Ensure all development and testing are conducted in isolated, controlled environments.
        Do not deploy or test the malware on any real or production systems.

    Documentation:
        Provide thorough, clear documentation for all steps and processes.
        Ensure reproducibility by including all necessary configurations and commands.

    Tools and Techniques:
        Highlight the use of advanced tools and techniques for malware development, analysis, and detection.
        Demonstrate a deep understanding of both offensive and defensive security practices.

This project will showcase your ability to develop, analyze, and defend against sophisticated malware, highlighting your technical expertise in cybersecurity.
